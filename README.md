An application designed to help people with color blindness. We were inspired by the work of Miguel Neiva, a Portuguese designer who in 2010 created a visual code for the colors.
<br>
How does it work?
<br>
It captures the colors, point the camera at the object or area you want to learn about, and have an instant analysis of the color and hue. You can click the crosshairs to freeze the selected screen and color. If you want to know more about how the visual code for the colors works, just swipe to the left and have fun with our color puzzle. To see the world as someone 100% color blind, swipe to the right and switch to colorblindness mode.
